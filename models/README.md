# Models

This directory contains AI models used for face detection and recognition.

## Files
- `deploy.prototxt` - DNN architecture definition for face detection
- `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel` - Pre-trained weights for face detection

## Usage
These models are used by `face_matcher.py` and `face_matcher_v2.py` for OpenCV-based face detection.
